# Classification-Challenge
In this challenge, I trained a classification model to analyze the chemical and visual features of wine samples and classify them based on their cultivar (grape variety).
Wine experts can identify wines from specific vineyards through smell and taste, but the factors that give different wines their individual charateristics are actually based on their chemical composition.
